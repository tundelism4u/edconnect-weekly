    <h3>Project Abstract</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            The present system of the insurance companies is characterized by the manual method as a result serious threat has been posed to the operation of the service and too much workload on the staffs. The manual method involves the marketing staffs moving from one location to the other to meet up with the requirement of their broker and also the files and data of their broker are stored in cabinet which are easily destroyed by rodents. With regards to this method the online insurance management system for insurance company would be developed this would have the ability to remotely connect insurance brokers in any location for them to carry out their insurance services and also their data would be stored in a secured database. In the software design, to achieve this task I intend to use Html, Javascript and Css as the front end, Php as the back end and Msql Database for the database aspect.
